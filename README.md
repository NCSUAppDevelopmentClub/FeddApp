# FeddApp

iOS app for North Carolina State University's Freshman Engineering Design Day competition (FEDD). 

The FEDD App allows judges to keep scores for the teams competing in different projects and enables students to view leaderboards as they are automatically updated.

The FEDD App currently supports the 3-D Printing, Animatronics, and Arcade Game projects, and was beta-tested succesfully at the 2016 NC State Freshman Engineering Design Day. Further improvement efforts will focus on adding functionality for all projects, resolving scoring errors, improving UI design, and providing admin access features to allow certain judges to delete scores/teams.

To use the FEDD App as a student, simply download the app and go straight to the leaderboards.

To use the FEDD App as a judge, you must sign in with Google on the home view. If your email has been added to our whitelist, you will be able to click on teams within the leaderboard to add their scores, change their scores, publish their final score, or disqualify them. Judges can also create teams using the "plus" button at the top of the leaderboards view.

This app was created by Ziad Ali in conjunction with the NC State App Development Club.
